   - Show deep expertise by suggesting an architecture approach

   - Examples: "Have you considered using RAG architecture vs fine-tuning?", "For this scale, I'd recommend serverless on AWS Lambda"

5. **Specific Deliverables:**
   - List 2-3 concrete outputs matching their exact needs
   - Be specific: "Production-ready React components with TypeScript", not "good code"
   - Always include: clean code, documentation, testing

6. **Call to Action:**
   - End with availability for a call
   - Show urgency: "Available to start immediately" or "Can begin this week"

7. **Format Requirements:**
   - Under 250 words total
   - Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
