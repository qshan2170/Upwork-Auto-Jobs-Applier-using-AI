3 Key Advantages Over Generic AI Tools：
"Why not just use Flux, Nano-Banana, Sora 2, or other AI tools?"

1. Your Product Stays True to Life—Zero Distortion
Generic AI Problem: Products get distorted, proportions altered—"something alike" but not YOUR product
Our Solution:
- Products' appearance remain identical to original
- Dimensions and proportions stay true to real-world measurements
- No distortion or "AI weirdness"—confidently use for marketing

2. Precise Product Placement—Full Creative Control
Generic AI Problem: Random placement, no control, inconsistent results
Our Solution:
- You decide exactly where products go: left wall, right wall, centered, angled
- Control camera distance, height, rotation
- Consistent placements across multiple room styles

3. Multi-Angle Mastery + Professional Video
Generic AI Problem: Each angle needs new generation, inconsistent results
Our Solution:
- Unlimited angles from single image: front, 45°, side, overhead, close-ups
- All angles maintain perfect consistency
- Camera movement with fully control: smooth orbits, zoom-ins, pan shots

(Optional) products' 3D model file may improve quality. Please provide us with the glb file or 3ds max file with materials. Please ensure that the 3D file does not contain animations.
- Product Dimensions: Exact measurements
- Style direction: Example "after" images / videos, especially the specific room styles or scenarios you want to showcase
